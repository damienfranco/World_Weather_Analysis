# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project was designed to generate interactive maps with Google Maps, Places, and Directions APIs that give a travel itinerary based on a user-inputted temperature range for their holiday.

## Major Milestones
- Weather information for ~2000 random locations on the globe, including longitude and latitude.
- The app will then provide a comprehensive list of locations to visit, filtered by minimum and maximum temperatures according to user input.
- Users can now plan their trip based on the filtered cities to create a personalized itinerary that includes suggested hotels based on cities they will visit.

## Results
As part of the project, a number of dataframes were created to meet the objectives of each deliverable. These were subsequently exported to CSV and/or displayed on Google Maps using API and widgets within Jupyter Notebook. The images generated as part of this project are shown below.
